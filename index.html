            <h3>what we're doing</h3>
            <p>We are increasing safety and efficiency of helicopter rescue operations by designing a 
                mechatronics system to stop the uncontrolled spinning of helicopter hoisted payloads.
            </p>
            <h3>why we're doing it</h3>
            <p>
                During helicopter rescue operations, environmental factors such as wind and rotor downwash can cause the rescuer or the rescue subject to spin uncontrollably while being hoisted. 
                Rescuers often suffer wrist and ankle injuries in trying to stabilize themselves if they touch down while spinning. 
                Excessive spinning can cause nausea and dizziness which is especially dangerous for a rescue subject who is already in a vulnerable state.
                In one instance, an Arizona woman spun at 150 revolutions per minute while being rescued. She required extended medical care and sued the city of Phoenix for $2 million. 
                Presently there is no solution to stop the uncontrolled spinning of all rescue payloads in all scenarios. Only best practices exist to avoid spinning.
