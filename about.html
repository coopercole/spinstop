            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>During helicopter rescue operations, environmental factors such as wind and rotor downwash can cause the rescuer or the rescue subject to spin uncontrollably while being hoisted. Rescuers often suffer wrist and ankle injuries in trying to stabilize themselves if they touch down while spinning. Excessive spinning can cause nausea and dizziness which is especially dangerous for a rescue subject who is already in a vulnerable state. In one instance, an Arizona woman spun at 150 revolutions per minute while being rescued. She required extended medical care and sued the city of Phoenix for $2 million. 
            Presently there is no solution to stop the uncontrolled spinning of all rescue payloads in all scenarios. Only best practices exist to avoid spinning. 
            The spinning of the helicopter hoisted payload adds extra complexity and time to each rescue mission, while also posing an injury hazard to rescue operators and subjects.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>Our design will connect the rescue payload to the helicopter hoist cable via an intermediary system that can detect when the payload starts spinning, and apply an appropriate torque to the payload to stop its spin. Being an intermediary system, it can have the appropriate mechanical interface to connect to any existing helicopter cables and any rescue payloads, allowing it to be easily added and removed without having to change existing helicopter systems.
