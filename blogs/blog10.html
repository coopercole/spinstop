                Hello SpinStop Supporters!
                <br><br>
                In the dynamic world of startups, progress isn't a solo journey; it's a collaborative dance. We're thrilled to share some exciting updates on the incredible support we've received for SpinStop.
                <br><br>
                Firstly, a massive shoutout to Brent of <a href="https://brentswelding.com/">Brent's Welding</a> in KW. We reached out to Brent, and he's on board to help us with the fabrication of our housing. Brent, your support means the world to us, and we can't wait to see the craftsmanship you bring to SpinStop.
                <br><br>
                But that's not all - we've got more good news. A big thank you to <a href="https://1517fund.com/">1517 Medici Grant</a> for their financial support. Their belief in our project has not only fueled our progress but has also ignited our excitement to keep working hard.
                <br><br>
                We're deeply grateful for each supporter who's been part of this journey. Your encouragement propels us forward, and we're committed to making you proud.
                Stay tuned as we progress further with our new supporters.
