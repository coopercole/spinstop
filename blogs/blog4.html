            <h2>Solution Ideation and Research</h2>
            <p>Oct 1, 2023</p>

                Hello SpinStop enthusiasts!
                <br><br>
                Now that we've laid the groundwork, it's time to roll up our sleeves and delve into the world of possible solutions. Buckle up as we explore the creative process behind crafting a mechanism to tackle the uncontrollable spin of hoisted helicopter rescue payloads.
                <br><br>
                Our journey began by throwing all our ideas onto the table, creating a list that embraced creativity without bounds. We were determined to leave no stone unturned in our quest for an ingenious solution.
                <br><br>
                From the chaos of brainstorming, four contenders emerged as our favorites. Each held its own promise, each sparked our curiosity. These are the stars of our show:
                <br><br>
                Passive Spin Damper: As the payload spins, aero surfaces on the device are passively angled in such a way that the new redirection of air opposes the force that caused the spin.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Active Aero Surfaces: Actuators move radially spaced flaps/airfoils that direct incoming rotor downwash or wind gusts such that a reaction torque is applied to the system. 
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Propeller Thrusters: Place propellers offset from the payload's axis of rotation. Inertial sensor detects when payload starts spinning. Controller actuates the propellers to turn and push against the air, thereby creating a torque on the payload about its axis of rotation to counter its spin.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Reaction Wheel: Reaction wheel system applies the required torque to the payload in the necessary direction and for the required amount of time. Inertial sensor detects when payload starts spinning. A controller will control the motor to spin the wheel in the same direction as the payload. This creates a torque in the opposite direction, countering the payload spin.

                Each solution is a testament to our commitment to good design. In the coming posts, we'll dive into the intricacies of each concept, exploring their feasibility, challenges, and the potential they hold for SpinStop.
                Stay tuned for the design journey as we transform these ideas from concepts into reality!
