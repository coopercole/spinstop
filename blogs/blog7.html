            <h2>Detailed Design</h2>
            <p>Oct 27, 2023</p>
            <p>
                Hello SpinStop enthusiasts!
                <br><br>
                Now, for the part we've all been waiting for - the nitty-gritty of the detailed design phase. Buckle up, because things are about to get exciting!
                <br><br>
                First things first - we observed our system needs. Armed with the insights gathered from our preliminary design presentation, we hit the drawing board, quite literally. Picture this: a beautiful, abandoned chalkboard (seriously, who leaves such a gem lying around?). We sketched diagrams, mapped out ideas, and let creativity flow in those moments of chalk dust magic.
                <br><br>
                With a clear vision of what we needed, it was time for some serious business - component selection. Jerry, armed with his physics and math prowess, took charge of the reaction wheel sizing. Sam dived into calculations and CAD for the mechanical design, ensuring every detail was meticulously accounted for.
                <br><br>
                Take a look at Jerry's great work below:

                But that's not all - enter Phil, our embedded systems guru, who embarked on the complex journey of firmware programming. And while the digital magic was happening, Cooper joined forces with Phil, simultaneously contributing to the embedded systems and building our SpinStop website.
                <br><br>
                It's a symphony of skills, each team member bringing their unique expertise to the table. The synergy is electric, and we're thrilled to witness the pieces of SpinStop falling into place.
                <br><br>
                As we delve into the detailed design, stay tuned for behind-the-scenes glimpses, technical insights, and perhaps a few more discoveries of abandoned chalkboards. The journey is picking up speed, and we're ecstatic to have you along for the ride!
