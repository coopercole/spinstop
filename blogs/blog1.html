                Hey everyone!
                <br><br>
                Almost two years ago, we embarked on a journey fueled by curiosity and a shared passion for engineering. It all began with a simple act: jotting down potential project ideas. The whiteboard became a canvas for our creativity, hosting a myriad of possibilities.
                <br><br>
                Fast forward to this past summer, where we took a deep dive into our ideas. Each of us took the reins of an idea, exploring its viability and potential. Simultaneously, we reached out to companies, seeking partnerships that could bring our concepts to life.
                <br><br>
                Amidst the sea of possibilities, four options emerged as contenders. It was decision time, and after some contemplation, we zeroed in on something that captured our collective imagination - controlling the uncontrollable spin of hoisted helicopter rescue payloads. We named it SpinStop!
                <br><br>
                Why SpinStop, you ask? Well, it ticked all the right boxes. It addressed a meaningful problem, had a scope that excited us, and promised a complete engineering challenge that we couldn't resist.
                <br><br>
                A special shoutout to Sam for not just discovering the problem but championing the idea throughout. It's been an exhilarating journey to arrive at this point, and we can't wait to share the ins and outs of our engineering escapade.
                <br><br>
                Stay tuned for more updates as we navigate the twists and turns of bringing SpinStop to life. This is just the beginning!
