            <h2>Final Design Presentation</h2>
            <p>Nov 27, 2023</p>
            <p>
                Hey guys!
                <br><br>
                As the term comes to a close, we're excited to share the highlights of our Final Design Presentation - a culmination of weeks of hard work and dedication.
                <br><br>
                Here's a snapshot of what went down:
                <br><br>
                1. Progress Overview Since the Preliminary Design Presentation (PDP): We took a journey back in time, revisiting the progress made since our PDP. It was more than just a presentation; it was a showcase of the progress we made as a team.
                <br><br>
                2. System Overview: The big reveal! We presented a comprehensive overview of the components that will orchestrate the magic of SpinStop. It's not just a collection of parts; it's a symphony of engineering brilliance.
                <br><br>
                3. Deep Dive into the Technicalities:
                <br>
                Software State Machine: The brains (Phil) behind the operation.
                <br>
                Reaction Wheel Sizing: Jerry's physics and math prowess at play.
                <br>
                Mechanical Design: Sam's calculations and CAD wizardry.
                <br><br>
                4. V0 Prototype Demo - Hector: We brought Hector, our V0 prototype (remember the bomb?), to the stage, span him, he span back and stopped. Everyone liked that.
                <br><br>
                As we approach Christmas break, our commitment to SpinStop doesn't take a holiday. We'll be hard at work, especially on the looming big report that's due soon.
                <br><br>
                Stay tuned for more updates, technical deep dives, and perhaps a few holiday surprises. The SpinStop journey continues, and we're grateful to have you on board!
