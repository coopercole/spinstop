            <h2>Velocity Pitch Competition</h2>
            <p>Nov 15, 2023</p>
            <p>
                Hello!
                <br><br>
                As our journey unfolds, we're thrilled to share an exciting chapter involving Velocity's $5k Pitch competition - a local incubator thatss become a hub for innovation and support.
                <br><br>
                Here's the rundown:
                <br>
                1. Application to Velocity $5k Pitch Competition: We took a shot and applied to Velocity's $5k Pitch competition, aiming to showcase SpinStop's potential on a larger stage.
                <br>
                2. Selection and Invitation: Out of over 100 applicants, we were among the 24 teams selected to participate. It was an honor to be recognized among such a talented pool of innovators.
                <br>
                3. The Pitch: The moment arrived to present our vision to a panel of judges for a chance to win $5k in funding. Sam, our fearless leader, took the stage and delivered a fantastic pitch.
                <br>
                4. Learning from the Experience: While the competition was fierce and we didn't make it to the finals, the experience was invaluable. We gleaned insights and left with a renewed determination to push SpinStop even further.
                <br><br>
                This competition was just a pit stop in our journey, and we're excited to share the lessons learned and the strides we're making. Stay tuned for more updates, more challenges, and, of course, more progress!
